Solution of the problem 7 of this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC7o8P_Ste4&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
WHhen i saw the video i found out that my algorithm is quite opmtmal,the central idea is to gravitate the x´s to a predetermined center,for example:
if there is 3 x´s you gravitate them towards the central x,if the number o x[s is even you have 2 "center" so you arbitraly choose one or another.In fact probably there are a lot of opmitzations that can be done in my code,but the algorithm itself is optmal since i don´t have to have any nested for loops.
